# Bike Sharing Case Study
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## General Information
**Background:** A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

**Business Problem:**  The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes; How well those variables describe the bike demands

**Dataset:** The project utilizes historical data on past bike demands. This dataset provides various features associated with each customer when they rent a bike

## Recommendations
1. Focus on understanding and leveraging the factors associated with the year to enhance bike usage.
2. Pay attention to weather conditions, especially high wind speeds, and provide alternative transportation options on such days.
3. Consider implementing strategies to mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions on bike rentals, such as offering discounts during poor weather.
4. Capitalize on the seasonal patterns by implementing season-specific promotions or events to boost bike rentals during these times.
